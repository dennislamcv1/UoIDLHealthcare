    "While CNNs can efficiently process spatial information, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are designed to better handle sequential information. RNNs introduce state variables to store past information, together with the current inputs, to determine the current outputs.\n",

    "That is, let us say we have a sequence $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_t$. RNN attempts to model the conditional probability: $P(x_t \\mid x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{t-1})$. More specifically, RNN leverages a hidden state variable  that stores the sequence information up to time step $t−1$:\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we have a minibatch of inputs $\\mathbf{X}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ at time step $t$. In other words, for a minibatch of $n$ sequence examples, each row of $\\mathbf{X}_t$ corresponds to one example at time step $t$ from the sequence. Next, denote by $\\mathbf{H}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$ the hidden variable of time step $t$. Further, we save the hidden variable $\\mathbf{H}_{t-1}$ from the previous time step and introduce a new weight parameter $\\mathbf{W}_{hh} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times h}$ to describe how to use the hidden variable of the previous time step in the current time step. Specifically, the calculation of the hidden variable of the current time step is determined by the input of the current time step together with the hidden variable of the previous time step:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{H}_t = \\phi(\\mathbf{X}_t \\mathbf{W}_{xh} + \\mathbf{H}_{t-1} \\mathbf{W}_{hh}  + \\mathbf{b}_h).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the relationship between hidden variables $\\mathbf{H}_{t}$ and $\\mathbf{H}_{t-1}$ of adjacent time steps, we know that these variables captured and retained the sequence’s historical information up to their current time step, just like the state or memory of the neural network’s current time step. Therefore, such a hidden variable is called a hidden state. Since the hidden state uses the same definition of the previous time step in the current time step, the computation of $\\mathbf{H}_{t}$ is recurrent. Hence, neural networks with hidden states based on recurrent computation are named recurrent neural networks. Layers that perform the computation of $\\mathbf{H}_{t}$ in RNNs are called recurrent layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For time step $t$, the output of the output layer is similar to the computation in the MLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{O}_t = \\mathbf{H}_t \\mathbf{W}_{hq} + \\mathbf{b}_q.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters of the RNN include the weights $\\mathbf{W}_{xh} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times h}, \\mathbf{W}_{hh} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times h}$, and the bias $\\mathbf{b}_h \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times h}$ of the hidden layer, together with the weights $\\mathbf{W}_{hq} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times q}$ and the bias $\\mathbf{b}_q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times q}$ of the output layer. It is worth mentioning that even at different time steps, RNNs always use these model parameters. Therefore, the parameterization cost of an RNN does not grow as the number of time steps increases.\n",

    "### 3.2 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge to address long-term information preservation and short-term input skipping in latent variable models has existed for a long time. One of the earliest approaches to address this was the long short-term memory (LSTM) ([Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/9/8/1735/6109/Long-Short-Term-Memory)). It shares many of the properties of the GRU. Interestingly, LSTMs have a slightly more complex design than GRUs but predates GRUs by almost two decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM introduces a memory cell (or cell for short) that has the same shape as the hidden state, engineered to record additional information. To control the memory cell we need a number of gates. One gate is needed to read out the entries from the cell. We will refer to this as the output gate. A second gate is needed to decide when to read data into the cell. We refer to this as the input gate. Last, we need a mechanism to reset the content of the cell, governed by a forget gate. The motivation for such a design is the same as that of GRUs, namely to be able to decide when to remember and when to ignore inputs in the hidden state via a dedicated mechanism.\n",
